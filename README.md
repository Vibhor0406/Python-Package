# mluno: A Univariate Regression Package

## Overview
**mluno** is a Python package I developed to implement various univariate regression methods from scratch. The goal was to build a flexible, lightweight library that performs essential tasks in a machine learning workflow, specifically focused on univariate regression. The package includes features for data simulation, model training, prediction, evaluation, and visualizationâ€”without relying on existing machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`. Instead, `mluno` is built using only `numpy` and `matplotlib`.

## Features
**mluno** provides the following core functionalities:
- **Data Simulation**: Generate synthetic datasets tailored for regression tasks.
- **Data Splitting**: Seamlessly split datasets into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Train univariate regression models from scratch.
- **Prediction**: Make predictions using the trained models.
- **Prediction Intervals**: (Optional) Generate prediction intervals for better uncertainty estimation.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compute important regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Visualization**: Visualize the models and prediction results with easy-to-use plotting functions.

## Motivation
The motivation behind creating **mluno** was to get hands-on experience with fundamental machine learning algorithms and reinforce a deep understanding of univariate regression. While libraries like `scikit-learn` offer excellent implementations, building this package from scratch allowed me to explore the inner workings of these algorithms and control every aspect of their implementation.
